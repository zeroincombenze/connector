2.2.0 (2014-05-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Job arguments can now contain unicode strings (thanks to St√©phane Bidoul) lp:1288187
* List view of the jobs improved
* Jobs now support multicompany (thanks to Laurent Mignon) https://lists.launchpad.net/openerp-connector-community/msg00253.html)
* An action can be assigned to a job.  The action is called with a button on the job and could be something like open a form view or an url.

2.1.1 (2014-02-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A user can be blocked because he has no access to the model queue.job when a
  job has been delayed. The creation of a job is low level and should not be
  restrained by the accesses of the user. (lp:1276182)

2.1.0 (2014-01-15 - warning: breaks compatibility)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add a new optional keyword argument 'description' to the delay() function of a
  job.  If given, the description is used as name of the queue.job record stored
  in OpenERP and displayed in the list of jobs.
* Fix: assignment of jobs to workers respect the priority of the jobs (lp:1252681)
* Pass a new parameter to listeners of 'on_record_create' ( vals:  field values
  of the new record, e.g {'field_name': field_value, ...})
* Replace the list of updated fields passed to listeners of 'on_record_write'
  by a dictionary of updated field values e.g {'field_name': field_value, ...}
* Add the possibility to use 'Modifiers' functions in the 'direct
  mappings' (details in the documentation of the Mapper class)
* When a job a delayed, the job's UUID is returned by the delay() function
* Refactoring of mappers. Much details here:

2.0.1 (2013-09-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Developers of addons do no longer need to create an AbstractModel with a _name 'name_of_the_module.installed',
  instead, they just have to call connector.connector.install_in_connector() lp:1196859
* Added a script `openerp-connector-worker` to start processes for Jobs Workers when running OpenERP is multiprocessing
* Fix: inheritance broken when an orm.Model inherit from an or.AbstractModel. One effect was that the mail.thread features were no longer working (lp:1233355)
* Fix: do no fail to start when OpenERP has access to a not-OpenERP database (lp:1233388)
